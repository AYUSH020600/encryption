          Image Encryption is done using algorithms like:-<br />
          1. Image Encryption Technique Based On Combination of Block
          Displacement and Block Cipher Technique <br />2. Image Encryption
          based on the RGB PIXEL Transposition and Shuffling <br />3. Enhanced
          Colour Visual Cryptography <br />4. Image Encryption Based on
          Explosive Inter-pixel Displacement of the RGB Attributes of a Pixel
          <br />5. Permutation based Image Encryption Technique <br />6. Image
          Encryption Using Block-Based Transformation Algorithm <br />And it
          will do Text encryption and decryption using AES algorithm. Advanced
          Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of
          electronic data established by the U.S National Institute of Standards
          and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is widely used today as it is a
          much stronger than DES and triple DES despite being harder to
          implement.
